	Added AssemblyVersion.tt 
	Added Changelog
	Added ReadMe

1.3.1
	Changed regex for true/false handling to be case insensitive.

1.3.0
	Math parsing now caches results so that duplicate formulas do not need to be parsed repeatedly.
	Version is stored as the file version on the assembly now.

1.2.5
	Version bumped for KSP 1.3, but otherwise unchanged. Should still work in 1.2.2 as well.

1.2.4
	Allows the use of "seq" and "sneq" in if statements for simple string comparisons
	Allow "ln" and "log" for natural log and log base 10, instead of just "l" and "L"
	Replace occurrences of "true" and "false" with "1" and "0" in math parsing
	Added some additional exception handling around math parsing

1.2.1
	BREAKING: Math Parsing now requires an "identifier" string formula and fires an event that
		allows other mods to add their own variables without a hard dependency. Example identifier
		from KCT: "KCT_BUILD_RATE". The identifier allows mods to filter which formulas to apply 
		variables to. Change only breaks mods that use math parsing (pretty much just KCT, which 
		wasn't updated to 1.2.2 officially and the beta already uses this version)
	Uses KSPs values for the length of a year, day, hour, and minute so as to support any weird times that might get set by planet modifying mods.

1.1.3
	Just a version bump for KSP 1.2.2

1.1.1
	Update to KSP 1.1.2
	Slight rework of license location and name
	Code basically identical to 1.1.0

1.1.0
	Updated for KSP 1.1.1.
	Added math parsing functionality from KCT
	Added basic if statements: "if(VALUE1 == VALUE2 ? RESULT1 : RESULT2)"
	Supported comparators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
	Added time parsing functionality from KCT
	Added several utility functions
	Added .version file so CKAN can get KSP info and version info easier

1.0.1
	Changed license to MIT and compiled against KSP 1.0.5. Otherwise zero changes. Hopefully CKAN catches this and it makes DQ and SS update.

1.0.0
	Initial MagiCore release with StringTranslation abilities for shared string replacement in SensibleScreenshots and Dated QuickSaves.
